"""Bitemporal stamping of physical schemas (DESIGN-ADDENDUM-bitemporal).

Every schema version has two clocks. **Transaction time** is when RSA looked; **valid
time** is when the definition became true of the source. Only the second is hard: nothing
downstream can reconstruct when a table was altered, and RSA is the only component that
reads the relational catalogs. So RSA records both — and records nothing else. It stays
stateless, ``schema_diff`` stays pure, and the history lives in the temporal store.

What makes this more than plumbing is that **the catalogs disagree about what "last
altered" means**:

* Snowflake's ``LAST_ALTERED`` moves on DML as well as DDL — an unchanged table that was
  merely inserted into looks freshly altered.
* MySQL's ``CREATE_TIME`` does not move on ``ALTER`` at all, so an altered table looks
  older than it is.
* PostgreSQL has no DDL timestamp whatsoever.

A naive "read the catalog date" rule would therefore be wrong on three of the nine
sources. The fingerprint RSA already computes is what rescues it (§2.3): a catalog date is
believed only when the structure actually changed. Otherwise the previous date is carried
forward, and the result says so.

Two consequences worth stating plainly, because they are the difference between an
auditable record and a plausible-looking one:

* ``valid_time_source`` always accompanies ``valid_from``. A date whose provenance is
  unknown cannot be audited, and "we had no signal so we used the clock" (``observed``) is
  a fact a reader must be able to see rather than infer.
* The schema-level source is the **weakest** among its tables, so a schema is never
  advertised as ``catalog``-dated when one of its tables was only ``observed``.

RSA does not record ``valid_to``: a version is open-ended at observation, and closing it
is the store's job when a successor arrives.
